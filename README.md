# conversational_Intent_modelling
Objective: This repository aims to clustering conversational turns into groups of similar intents or topics by using mainly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and fasttext model. This is a complicated problem since no intent label is available for each turn and moreover, each turn can have more than one intents.
